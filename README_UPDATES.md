## ðŸ¤– OpenAI Integration (New in v4.2)

The Verifiable Agent Kit now includes OpenAI integration for intelligent parsing of complex natural language commands:

### Complex Multi-Person Workflows
```bash
# Natural language command
"If Alice is KYC verified send her 0.05 USDC on Solana and if Bob is KYC verified send him 0.03 USDC on Ethereum"

# Automatically generates:
1. Generate KYC proof for Alice
2. Verify KYC proof for Alice  
3. Transfer 0.05 USDC to Alice on Solana (conditional)
4. Generate KYC proof for Bob
5. Verify KYC proof for Bob
6. Transfer 0.03 USDC to Bob on Ethereum (conditional)
```

### Features
- **Intelligent parsing** of complex conditional logic
- **Multi-person support** in a single workflow
- **Natural language variations** understood
- **Automatic fallback** to regex parser if OpenAI unavailable
- **GPT-3.5-turbo** for broad compatibility

### Configuration
Add your OpenAI API key to `.env`:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here
```

## ðŸ”§ Recent Fixes (v4.2)

### UI Improvements
- Fixed duplicate verification cards in workflows
- Fixed transfer polling that wouldn't stop after completion
- Improved real-time workflow status updates

### Parser Enhancements  
- Multi-person conditional transfer support
- Case-insensitive condition matching
- Automatic verification step insertion
- Person-specific proof storage

## ðŸ“š Architecture Note

Despite the filename `langchain_service.py`, this service uses direct OpenAI API calls rather than LangChain. This design choice keeps the integration simple and focused on the core functionality of parsing workflows for zkEngine execution.
