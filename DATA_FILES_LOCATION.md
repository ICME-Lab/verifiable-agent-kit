# Data Files Location

During development, data files are created in `scripts/utils/`:
- `proofs_db.json` - Proof database
- `verifications_db.json` - Verification records
- `workflow_history.json` - Workflow execution history
- `kyc_transfers.json` - KYC transfer records

These files will be created automatically when running the application.
